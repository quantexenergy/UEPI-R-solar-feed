# UEPI-R Solar Feed

This repository publishes the **public JSON feed** generated by UEPI-R (Quantex Energy).
The detection code and tuning are maintained in a **private repository**; this repo contains outputs only.

Files:
- `uepi_r_public.json` — latest public status snapshot
- `uepi_r_public_transitions.json` — recent tier/state transitions

Note: UEPI-R is a **causal solar instability detector** (regime warning). Outputs indicate elevated flare risk, not guaranteed flare timestamps.
